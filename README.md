# Open Jobs for the Rackspace Developer Experience Team

The Rackspace Developer Experience Team is looking for a range of skills and
roles. Take a look at the repository for open jobs; they're in markdown, so you
know we're okay people.

Our team is dedicated to making the end-to-end experience
for developers, technologists, and all customers on our cloud platform, the best
experience it can be. We specialize in community outreach, documentation,
client tools, and SDKs. We are on the front lines: engaging with our developers
and helping them build modern cloud applications, setting technical strategy for
content, tools, ecosystems and more.

We sponsor OSS programs and projects, contribute upstream and foster communities.
The team operates on the bleeding edge - from containers, to emerging tools,
techniques and other technologies. This is a chance to make a strategic impact
not just to one team and company - but for the wider developer community!

If you believe in helping define, lead, and drive strategies focused on the
technical end-user, as well as leading and growing a team of senior software
developers, then we want to talk to you!

## Open Jobs:

**Don't be daunted by skills / requirements: if you even know 70% of what we've
outlined, you're welcome to apply. Our team thrives off of mentoring one another
and growing. Of course, if you're senior - we expect you to mentor developers
earlier in their careers**
